# amazon-homepage
This is a responsive Amazon homepage clone built using HTML and CSS. It replicates Amazon’s UI with a clean and modern design. The project uses Flexbox and Grid for layout, custom fonts, and icons for styling. It’s a great practice project for front-end development. Future updates may include JavaScript for interactivity.
